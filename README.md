# Caf-website
list of cafes 

I developed a website that allows users to view, create, update, and delete cafe listings using Python and CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations. The website uses a database to store the cafe information, which is accessed and modified through a server-side application built with Python and a web framework such as Flask. The client-side of the website is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and allows users to browse the cafe listings and submit new entries or updates through a form. This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a full-stack web application using modern technologies and good coding practices.
